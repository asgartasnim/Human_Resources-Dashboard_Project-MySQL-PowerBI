• White race is the most dominant while Native Hawaiian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander are the least dominant.  
• The youngest employee is 23 years old and the oldest is 60 years old
• 5 age groups were created (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64). A large number of employees were between 35-44 followed by 25-34 while the smallest group was 18-24.  
• A large number of employees work at the headquarters instead of remotely.  
• The average length of employment for terminated employees is around 8 years.

• The net change in employees has increased over the years.

## Limitations
• Some records had negative ages and these were excluded during querying. Ages used were 18 years and above.  
• Some termdates were far into the future and were not included in the analysis. The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
